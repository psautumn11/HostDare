## Strategy 1: Link Building with Stock Photos

Using stock photos for link building is a lesser-known tactic that can yield impressive results. With minimal investment, you can generate dozens of backlinks every month—perfect for industries such as e-commerce, design-heavy websites, and even competitive niches like CBD or betting.

### Step 1: Create High-Quality Stock Images

- Use your existing inventory: If you’re in e-commerce, leverage product photos or other related imagery.
- Snap your own photos: Clear, shareable, and high-quality images are key. Browse stock image platforms for inspiration on what works well.
- Ensure your images are universally appealing: Broader topics tend to get more downloads.

### Step 2: Upload Images to Stock Image Platforms

Publish your images on popular stock image sites like Unsplash, Wikimedia, and Flickr. Track the uploaded images in a spreadsheet to monitor usage later.

**Pro Tip:** If managing uploads feels overwhelming, consider hiring a virtual assistant for this task.

### Step 3: Use Reverse Image Search to Identify Usage

Wait a month after uploading your images, then use Google’s reverse image search to track websites using your photos. Simply upload your image or paste the image URL into the search bar.

### Step 4: Outreach for Backlinks

Contact the site owners using your images and politely request attribution with a link to your site. Most website owners are happy to give credit when asked.

#### Outreach Email Template:
“Hi [Name],  
I noticed you’re using one of my images on your site. Thank you for sharing it! I’d appreciate it if you could add a link back to my site as credit. Here’s the link: [Your Website Link].  
Let me know if you have any questions.  
Best, [Your Name]”

## Strategy 2: Infographic Submissions for Backlinks

Infographics are an excellent way to gain backlinks while delivering value to your audience. Here’s how to use them effectively:

### Step 1: Create an Infographic with ChatGPT

Ask ChatGPT to design a concept for an infographic on your chosen topic. Focus on simple yet visually engaging data points or statistics.

### Step 2: Use Fiverr for Submissions

Upload your infographic to submission sites using Fiverr gigs. For as little as $5–15, you can have your infographic distributed to dozens of platforms. Make sure the provider offers a report for tracking submission sites.

**Important:** Avoid low-quality links on subdomains—they offer little to no SEO value. Focus on reputable platforms for long-term benefits.

### Step 3: Earn Referring Domains

Increasing the number of referring domains to your site protects against spam and improves your site authority. Infographic submissions help you achieve this without the hassle of manual outreach.

## Strategy 3: Curate Conference Slides for Link Building

Slide presentations are often overlooked in link-building strategies, but platforms like SlideShare can drive traffic and backlinks.

### Step 1: Collect Slides from Events

Compile slide decks from popular industry conferences or webinars. Many attendees look for these slides post-event, making them valuable content for curation.

### Step 2: Obtain Permissions

Ensure you have permission to share the slides. If slides are publicly shared by organizers or speakers, you’re good to go.

### Step 3: Publish and Promote

Upload the curated slides to SlideShare and other platforms. Promote them on your blog and social media to amplify reach and engagement.

### Step 4: Use Link Reclamation

Check where your slides have been embedded or shared. Reach out to those sites and request a backlink to your website.
