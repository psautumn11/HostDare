## What is Email Segmentation?

Email segmentation involves dividing your subscriber list into distinct groups based on demographics, behavior, or preferences. This strategy ensures that the content you deliver is highly relevant and personalized, leading to stronger engagement and improved results.

### Key Types of Email Segmentation:
- **Demographic Segmentation:** Categorizes subscribers by characteristics such as age, gender, location, or occupation. For example, tailoring emails for a young audience in urban areas versus retirees in rural regions.
- **Behavioral Segmentation:** Tracks user interactions like email open rates, clicks, or previous purchases to create personalized campaigns.
- **Preference-Based Segmentation:** Focuses on capturing what your subscribers value, such as preferred product categories or email frequency.
