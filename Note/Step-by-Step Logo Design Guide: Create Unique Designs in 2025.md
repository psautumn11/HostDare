When presenting the logo:

- Choose fonts that complement the brand’s personality and the logo’s overall style.

### Considerations:

## Step 6: Collecting Feedback

Once the initial concepts are shared with the client:
- Note their feedback and try to understand their perspective.
- Make necessary revisions based on their input.
- Provide 1–2 additional concepts with variations in color, layout, or font if required.

### Tips:
- Take inspiration from client feedback to refine the design.
- Ensure the client is fully satisfied before finalizing the logo.

## Step 7: Finalizing and Delivering Files

Finalize the chosen logo design by:
1. Preparing files in all necessary formats (e.g., AI, PNG, JPG, SVG).
2. Following industry standards to ensure the logo is versatile and usable across platforms.
3. Uploading the finalized files for the client’s approval.
